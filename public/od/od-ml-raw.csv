Video Transcript,
"0:00 Hi guys, I'm Ishan Roy.
0:02 I'll show you how to use a new ODML system which is made for us.
0:05 So this is basically a complete online platform.
0:08 So there's no need to apply for any physical forms.
0:10 Everything is done through this platform itself, so you don't have to run around with paper.
0:15 So first what we'll do is we'll enter the username, which is the registration number and in my case, this.
0:22 And if you are using the platform for the first time, you can just pretty much give the registration number as your password.
0:27 That is the default password just set for all students.
0:30 So I just added that.
0:32 And then you can click on sign in.
0:33 So it will sign in.
0:34 So preferably you would want to mostly change your password.
0:37 So first so you can go to the settings and then change password over here.
0:41 You can put the registration number and then I will just put in what password I want for my this thing for my account on this.
0:57 So once that is done, I'll just click on change password, password successfully search.
1:01 So that is done.
1:02 Then once that is done, you will need to actually you will have to first do this.
1:08 You have to update your profile.
1:10 Then only can you actually apply for leaves.
1:12 So go to my profile, you see an update profile button and click on that.
1:16 I have my details over here and after that you can just add in some basic details which are there K1 semester for me in semester 5 S and here three and then e-mail ID.
1:36 So we have done this.
1:37 We filled in all the details which are required.
1:39 These were refilled, I save and the profile updated.
1:43 Now we can apply for the leaf.
1:45 So you can go to manage leaf and over here you find apply leaf.
1:48 So over here you see all these details have been updated accordingly.
1:52 So that is it.
1:54 Now it's basically the same things which we had in the paper form just in a digital format.
1:58 So you can in my case, it's second OD with permissive assignment, which means that I did some work in the campus itself and I've got an OD for that.
2:07 And then you can click on the dates which are required.
2:10 For me, it is from 22nd to 22nd, which is it shows so that you have one day and then you can add the, you know the reason for this thing.
2:32 So we have done that.
2:34 Then after you can see there is another attached proof, basically whatever proof used to print out the same thing you just put over here.
2:39 So for me, I'll just come here, I'll go to here and I'll have my proof over here.
2:43 I've attached that it should be below 4 in the in a PDF format.
2:47 And then once it's done, you can just apply for leaf like that.
2:50 And it's simple here.
2:52 Leaf application successfully complete, then if you want to view the leave status, you can come to this view leave status over here, you'll see all this is there, the audio permissive assignment, everything which is there and you know all the FA academic advisor H2D, all their approvals will be shown.
3:08 So it's a simple process, you just have to wait for that to be done, etc.
3:12 Some things to be noted, this can only be done within on SRM IST in the academic blocks itself.
3:18 For example, if you are in tech park, you be Bell Biotech, etc.
3:22 Only these blocks, etc.
3:24 Like no similar blocks you can do it.
3:25 You cannot do it in hostile premises, you cannot do it in any other like Wi-Fi or mobile data or any other network.
3:32 So that is this is one very important point.
3:35 Apart from that it is a simple process.
3:37 You can see once done you will get all this marked and it will be reflected.
3:42 Thank you."
